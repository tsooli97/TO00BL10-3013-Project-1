My to-do list allows the user to add input text to a localstorage list. After that the user can select any task on the list by clicking on it to mark it as done. Marked tasks can be permanently deleted from the localstorage list. There's also a button to empty the to-do list e.g. in case the user accidentally marks the wrong task as done.
